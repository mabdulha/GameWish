About GameWish

This is an application which allows you to add games which you wish to have, to a list so you can have them all in one place.  It allows you to add a game to a 
database which will then be displayed in a list view.  You can then tap on the added game in the list view which will allow you to update or delete that selected 
game from the list view.


Persistence Approach Adopted

I decided to use SQLite Database to persist this app as it is relatively fast to read and write to the database rather then writing out individual files to the disk.
SQLite is also reliable as it can be updated continously and updated automatically so little or no work is lost in a crash.  In my application I used SQLite to add
data to the database and allowed the user to update or delete this data.  Everytime the app is closed, then opened again the data is still stored in the list view.
